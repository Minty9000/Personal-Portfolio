                <p>Welcome to the Home Screen! Here, you can browse all the sneakers currently in stock, with the display automatically scaling to fit any screen size. To enhance user experience, I've implemented a size sorter, allowing you to quickly find the sneakers in your desired size. This feature is powered by Java, which efficiently sorts through the data to provide accurate results.</p>

                <h1>Side Bar</h1>
                <p>On the left side of the screen, I've added an arrow icon that pulls up a menu when clicked, as shown in the image on the left. The sidebar was created using CSS, which includes an icon that, when clicked, triggers a Java function to display the sidebar. This function modifies specific CSS properties, such as changing display: none to display: block, to open and close the side menu seamlessly.                </p>

                <h1>Admin Page</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Admin Page, where I manage the sneakers in stock. To ensure security, I have included a password page to restrict access to authorized users only.As shown in the images below, the admin page features a form for adding new products, including fields for the name, price, image, and size of each sneaker using Java. This functionality is powered by a server hosted on Render. Since I'm using a free service, the server tends to shut down after 30 seconds of inactivity. To keep it running continuously, I implemented a recurring loop that pings the server every 15 seconds. Additionally, there is a section below the form that displays all the sneakers currently in stock. Each listed item includes a button for deleting the sneaker from the server. </p>
