              <h1>Excited to try New Things</h1>
              <p>Hello, my name is Gilbert, and I thank you for taking the time to look at my website. I was born in the United States, and I currently live in New Jersey, attending Rutgers University.  I am planning on double majoring in computer science and data science (Econ) and minoring in economics. I look forward to working within the computer science industry, as this is my first personal project that I have been working on, and if there are any bugs or improvements you think I should make, please let me know. Outside of computer science, I enjoy going to the gym and collecting shoes, as my house is filled to the brim with sneakers. I even have a small business selling shoes locally, and on ebay.  </p>
